    "*One of SpaceX's most popular rocket - the Falcon 9, have landed and reflown [more than 200 times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches) . The rocket was advertised on its website with a launch cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.*\n",

The main purpose is to find which factor contributes to the success of each flight and to build a Machine Learning model that can predict the outcome of a rocket launch.*"
