# **Mini Project: Analysis and Prediction of SpaceX Falcon9 rocket landing**

## INTRODUCTION

> *Space Exploration Technologies Corp. or SpaceX is an American spacecraft manufacturer, popular for their successful mission in sending a spacecraft and astronauts to the International Space Station. They are also well-known for their [VTVL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTVL) rocket launches , in which rockets can land and be resued, thus save a huge amount of launching cost for the company.*
>
> *One of SpaceX's most popular rocket - the Falcon 9, have landed and reflown [more than 200 times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches) . The rocket was advertised on its website with a launch cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.*

## IMPORTANT !!
- This original question & problem sets is initally a part of the IBM Data Science Specialization course. 
- After completing the I refined and further developed the notebooks, the dashboard app as well as the machine learning section by adding extra integrations, new features and personalizations (Details below)

## THE PROJECT COVERS
- `Python` programming
- Data collection: API data collection w. `requests` and webscraping w. `BeautifulSoup`
- Data wrangling with SQL using `mySQL`, `SQLalchemy`
- Exploratory analysis by visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Building an interactive dashboard using `dash` and `plotly.express`
- Train Machine Learning models to predict of future landing outcomes using classification techniques with `scikit-learn`

## ADDED FEATURES
### Notebooks
- Setting up local MySQL database (Originally IBM Skills Network Lab Environment)
### Dashboard app
- Styling with `dash_bootstrap_components`, external css, responsive customized layout
- Added multiple-inputs callbacks
- Added extra plots, statistic summary, global attribute selection and year slider
